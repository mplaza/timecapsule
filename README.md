# Timecapsule

###This is a time capsule that lives on the blockchain.


>You can stash tokens in here.
 Also, use this contract to record life events, thoughts at a moment in time, or anything you might want to provably leave on the blockchain.
Your grandkids can look through the blockchain one day and find your history in it.
This contract and contents are meant to be publicly viewed. Keep that in mind when you're adding to it!
